# Bot in a Day Workshop
### Microsoft Bot Framework and ASP Net Core

With the power of Azure cognitive services at your fingertips, it is the best time to be a developer! 

This workshop is meant to bring you up to speed with the latest cognitive services and chatbot related services offered by Azure. In the live workshop, we will see practical examples of chatbots that leverage a wide range of cognitive services including language understanding, speech recognition, and computer vision, and more!

To get started, clone this repo and follow the instructions in each lab. Starting with a basic "Echo Bot" that repeats whatever you say, we will work our way towards an intelligent commerce bot!
